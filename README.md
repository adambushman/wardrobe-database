# Wardrobe Database

A MySQL database of wardrobe items and daily outfit selections

## Description

Wardrobes are like the worst example of managing inventory; from having no clue about quantities or statuses, to not abiding by any rule like FIFO. I looked to solve some of these issues for myself and possibly inspire others with a database solution.

I desgin, create, and manage a MySQL database to catalog wardrobe clothing items and daily outfits with the goal of optimizing my wardrobe and honing my preferences with data. Follow along with the entire project via the link below.
